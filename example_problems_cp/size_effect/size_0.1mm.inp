!     A "cube of cubic grains" model designed to demonstrate the size-effect
!     the gradient hardening term brings into the CP formulation.  The model is
!     a cube consisting of 5x5x5 cubic grains each with edge length a.
!
!     In this particular model a = 0.1 mm.
!
!     The model is loaded in uniaxial tension (with symmetry constraints on
!     three of the model faces) to a large amount of plastic deformation.  
!     
!     Plotting the average stress at the final strain level versus the grain
!     size shows a Hall-Petch-type effect where decreasing the physical size
!     of the grains increases the stress (and hence smaller grains show
!     a higher flow stress).
!
!     In particular, for a = 0.1 mm at 5% strain sigma_xx_avg = 462.2 MPa
!     while for a = 0.001 mm sigma_xx_avg = 518.3 MPa.
!
!     Flat model and result files are generated for post-processing with ParaView.
!     The generated model file is "size_0.1.text". Flat results files
!     of nodal displacements, element stresses and element state variables
!     are generated every 5 load steps. The "stream" format for files
!     is used to reduce their size (compared to "text" files).
!
!     The Python program  $WARP3D_HOME/warp3d2exii/warp3d2exii will read
!     these files and produce an Exodus II .exo file to be read 
!     by ParaView.
!
!     This model demonstrates several features/uses of the CP model:
!
!      1) A CPFEM model -- each grain is represented by several finite elements,
!         each material point (Gauss point) models a single crystal orientation.
!
!      2) A basic MTS fit -- notice that the shear modulus of the material is
!         independent of temperature and the hardening properties are
!         relatively temperature and rate insensitive.
!
!      3) The length-scale effects introduced by the geometric hardening model.

!      ductile crack growth in a shallow notch se(b)
!      ============================================
!  
!              W=2 in,  span/2=4 in, B=0.001 in, a/W=0.15
!              uses crack growth by element extinction
!  
!      nonlinear material, large displacements, bbar,
!      large amounts of ductile crack growth with the Gurson-
!      Tvergaard material model. the finite element model
!      has one-layer of elements with w=0 constraints everywhere
!      to impose plane-strain conditions.
!  
!      computational "cell" size is D=200 um. due to symmetry then
!      the elements in the Gurson layer are 100 um x 100 um in size.
!  
!      we intentionally use large increments of imposed displacements
!      at the load point to create severe conditions for the
!      material model integration schemes and the adaptive solution
!      procedures. approximately 14 elements are killed in the first
!      40 load steps. After step ~30 lots of adaptive solutions are
!      present due to negative deformation jacobians in near tip
!      elements, strain increments > 100 * eps-0 in near-tip
!      elements, integration failure in the material model.
!  
!      the algorithms are designed to do whatever adaptivity
!      is required to push forward with the solution. the user
!      can then re-analyze the model with a much more realistic
!      (smaller) load step size.
!  
!      J-integral values are computed occasionally during loading.
!  
!      a restart file is also written along the way after every
!      10 or so load increments.
!  
!      here we employ catastrophic, strain-controlled nucleation
!      to smoothly relax stresses in elements just prior to
!      actually killing them.
!  
!      the material in linear + power law with n=10, E/sig-0=500,
!      nu=0.3. initial porosity in the cell is 0.005.

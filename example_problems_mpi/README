  Here are several files to examine. (most just run one step for testing
  parallel performance):

    test_1          : nonlinear analysis of a simple cantilever beam modeled
                      very small problem just to see if code compiled ok

    test_13         : a larger cantilever beam with more domains

    mt_panel        : middle crack tension panel set up for impact analysis with
                      2 domains

    big_cvn_models  : a 20,000 element model of a cvn specimen set up for
                      impact analysis. input files define serial, 2, 4,
                      8 and 16 domain decompositions for parallel
                      analysis.

    ct_ctoa         : small analysis of crack growth in a thin compact tension
                      specimen using CTOA. the model is set up to run with MPI
                      on 2 processors.

    mt_cohes_4_cpu  : analysis of crack growth in a thin aluminum panel using
                      interface elements and cohesive material model. setup
                      to run 4 way mpi parallel with threaded sparse direct
                      solver

    fgm_crack_panel : small (4 domain) model to compute J-integrals for
                      locations along a surface crack in a panel. Uses
                      interaction integrals to extract SIF

    pressure_vessel : a large model of a nuclear reactor pressure vessel
                      constructed with 20-node isoparametrics. No cracks.

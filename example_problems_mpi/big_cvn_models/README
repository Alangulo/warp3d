this directory contains a series of patran neutral files and warp3d
input files to analyze a 3-D model of a cvn specimen.

the model has 22140 nodes, 19334 8-node elements

the various models define different domain decompositions for
parallel processing.

the input files can be changed to use different solvers.

the analysis runs 1 load step.  the time step is 0.5 micro-secs.

the pcg solvers converge nicely for this example.

c	This is a test of pressure loading for a geometrically nonlinear
c       case.  The top four nodes of a cube are warped by 10% in different
c       directions, and then pressure loads are applied to all faces
c	except for the bottom face.  Previously, this test case was run
c	with debug flags on inside elem_load.f in the get_norm2 routine;
c	this confirmed that the face normals for geometrically nonlinear
c	problems were being calculated correctly.  Thus as long as the
c	answers from this problem are the same as from the HP version,
c	then the normals are being calculated correctly.
c
c	Material is linear_elastic.  10 steps are used to move the
c	originally cubic element into its deformed configuration, then
c	the pressure loads are applied in the 11th step.

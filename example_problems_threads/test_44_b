c   Mode I crack growth analysis in a C(T) specimen using 
c   interface elements and cohesive constitutive model
c **********************************************************
c
c   Model:
c   ------
c     problem units are kips and inches
c     model has one layer of solid elements over the thickness 
c     to reduce run time for purpose of an example problem.
c     W = 2.0 inches, B = mesh thickness B= 0.0225 inches
c     Initial a/W = 0.24, initial remaining ligament length = 1.52 in.
c     This is a 1/4 symmetric (i.e. full model would have 2 element
c     layers over full thickness in 3-D).
c     Model is not contrained to be in plane strain.
c     Background solitd elements are 8-node hex. 
c
c     model is placed in 1st (XYZ) quadrant. crack plane is Y=0,
c     mid-thickness symmetry plane is Z=0
c
c     Interface elements are 8-node, zero initial thickness.
c     Size on crack plane is Le= 0.02 in. in direction 
c     (+X) of crack extension. 76 interface elements defined
c     on initial ligamment = 1.52 in (analysis can effectively
c     grow crack across entire ligament)
c
c     displacement control loading at center of "pins"
c     holes are plugged with linear-elastic material to
c     "smooth" deformations in loading area. 
c
c   Materials:
c   ---------
c     Background: A2024-T3 aluminum, E = 10356 ksi, yiled = 48.5 ksi,
c                 power-law hardening n = 10 (true-stress vs. log eps)
c
c     Cohesive: ppr option. Paulino-Park_Roesler formulation. User
c               sets the peak traction, fracture energy, the shape
c               of the post-peak traction-separation curve and the 
c               (realtive) linear stiffness. 
c               Model computes the displacement jump at peak traction.
c               For this symmetric model, we input 1/2 of actual 
c               fracture energy since only 1/2 the "thickness" of the
c               interface elements exists in the symmetry model.
c               The cohesive elements represent a Mode I response
c               for a material with toughness Jc = 0.154 kip-in/in**2
c               (or KJc = 42 ksi-sqrt(in)).
c     Pin holes: displacement control loading at center of "pins"
c                holes are plugged with linear-elastic material to
c                "smooth" deformations in loading area. 
c
c     Notes: the PPR model provides full mix-mode treatment of the
c            cohesive fracture process. this example drives the fracture
c            process in simple Mode I. we set the normal and shear reponse
c            properties for PPR identical just for simplicity. the shear
c            values never affect the solution in this example.
c
c  Solution details:
c  -----------------
c
c   large displacement "nonlinear" element formulations used
c   for solid and interface elements
c
c   analysis runs for 500 load steps which kills about
c   30 cohesive elements (total delta "a" = 0.6 inches)
c
c   crack growth parameters may be adjusted to alter predicted
c   load vs. Delta-a behavior: the model computes the displacement 
c   jump at which the traction degrades to zero. The user may set 
c   a fraction (<=1) of this value at which the cohesive traction
c   drop to zero. Making this fraction 0.5 rather than 0.6, 
c   for example, "kills" the cohesive element earlier in its
c   path along the traction-separation curve.
c   
c   in this example, the ppr options are set to make the 
c   traction-separation curve match very closely the curve of
c   exp1_matl in the sister example problem.
c   alpha = beta = 7.0; ratio_normal = ratio_shear = 0.1
c   the exp1_intf material defintion is repeated below 
c   for completeness.

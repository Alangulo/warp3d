c
c  test of Interaction Integrals for mixed-mode
c  loading of a buried elliptical crack in an "infinite" body.
c
c  material is linear-elastic, homogeneous and isotropic
c
c  Model:
c    o  comprises a 3-D cube of dimension 50 x 50 x 50 centered
c       on the global origin
c
c  Crack:
c    o  crack plane lies in the global X-Y plane.
c    o  major axis of the ellipse coincides with the global X axis
c    o  minor axis of the ellipse coincides with the global Y axis
c    o  elliptical crack has size:  2a=5.0, 2c=2.0
c
c  Loading:
c    o  crack-face tractions provide the loading, which
c       induces mixed-mode loading in mode II and mode III.
c       for the interaction integral, exact numerical integration
c       is invoked for the crack-face traction term.
c    o  an alternate loading condition applies tension in global
c       Z-direction over the (+,-) Z ends of the cube
c
c  Constraints:
c    o  displacement boundary constraints are the minimum to prevent
c       rigid body motion
c
c  Elements:
c    o  the mesh is made of 8-node bricks with B-bar
c
c  Crack Driving Forces
c    o  J-domain and interaction integrals are computed at each corner
c       node along the entire elliptical crack front.

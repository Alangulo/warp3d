c
c     Model is loaded by imposed displacements (v) at top
c     of hole for loading pins. Pins are not modeled.
c     The same v displacement is imposed at each top of hole
c     node over the thickness.
c
c     Elements around the top of hole are defined to have a
c     material that remains linear elastic.
c
c     The top of hole step loading of 0.1 mils imposes
c     a LEFM KI of 0.903 ksi-in**5 at the center of the
c     model (z=0 midplane). The pin-loading for this displacement
c     is 77.88 lbf.
c
c     The 2-D analytical SIF is 0.901 using a thickness of sqrt(B*Bnet)
c
c     At step 100, the centerplane J is 0.224 kip-in/in**2
c     The blunted rho is ~ 8 x the initial rho
c     The CTOD is ~1.8 mils

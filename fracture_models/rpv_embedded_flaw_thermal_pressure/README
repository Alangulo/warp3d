    A533B vessel with austenitic stainless steel cladding.
    Axial oriented embedded, elliptical flaw located near clad-base
    interface.

    2a = 17 mm ( 0.67 in )
    2c = 102 mm ( 4.0 in )
    d = 2 mm ( 0.079 in )
         [ distance from clad-base interface to edge of flaw]


    Solution units: kips, in, temps in F

    Stress free temperature: 288 F

    Temperature dependent material properties for base and clad

    Vessel geometry, properties from generic RPV.
    Pressure-temperature for a Pressurized-Thermal-Shock
       from break in coolant line

    Analysis using 1000 load steps to drive 250 mins
    of the transient event

    Virtual memory size ~ 8 GB
    Estimated wall time for 1000 steps on 8-core MacPro
    (mid-2009):  14 hours running 8 threads

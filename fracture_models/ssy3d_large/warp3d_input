c
c      Very large 3-D SSY boundary layer model for
c      WARP3D testing.
c
c      104,145 20-node bricks; 443,654 nodes
c
c      Model is set up for serial or threaded-parallel
c      execution - not MPI.
c
c      The model has 15 layers of 20-node bricks with
c      a very refined in-plane meshing scheme.
c
c      The mesh is set up with rectangular shaped (in-plane)
c      elements in the crack front region - not a focused mesh.
c
c      The model can be used to support crack growth analysis via
c      node release for example.
c
c      Simple mises plasticity models the material.
c
c      The 14pt integration rule is needed to eliminate the
c      zero energy modes of the 8-pt rule that occurs in some 20-node
c      element models.
c
c      The block size 128 and probably should be larger.
c
c      A plane-stress KI field is imposed thru displacements on the
c      outer boundary of the model.
c
c      Solution is set up for 150 load steps - use the number of
c      steps desired for testing.

c SSY 3d Boundary Layer Model for Fatigue Crack Growth Analysis
c =============================================================
c
c  1/4 of the ssy boundary layer model (making use of 
c  symmetry planes through the thickness and about the 
c  crack plane)
c
c  Small, uniform elements in xy plane at and ahead of
c  crack tip for crack growth applications
c  Model units set up for: kN, mm

c Model features
c ==============
c - 8 node brick elements
c - 5 element layers in z-direction, with thicknesses of
c   0.25(adjacent to center symmetry plane), 0.15, 0.05, 
c   0.03 and 0.02 (free surface)
c - outer radius = 100 mm
c - thickness = 1 mm
c - element size ahead of crack front = 0.01 (in x and y direction)
c - small displacement formulation
c  
c Material:
c =========
c - bilinear elastic-plasticity (kinematic hardening)
c - E = 185 GPa (kN/mm^2), nu = 0.3
c - yield stress = 1.0 GPa
c - tangent modulus = 38 GPa
c 
c Loading:
c ========
c - remote KI displacement field imposed on outer circular boundary
c - maximum KI = 2 GPa x sqrt(mm) 
c - 50 load steps of delta KI = 0.04
c - At peak load, grow crack front by 1 element in +x direction
c - 50 unloading steps with delta KI = -0.04
c
c Output:
c =======
c - displacements of crack plane nodes output at step 50
c - Patran nodal displacement and stress files at steps 50 and 100
c
c Mesh Info:
c ========== 
c - crack tip initially located at x=-0.42, y=0 (nodes 6325, 6326,
c   6327, 6328, 6329, 6330)

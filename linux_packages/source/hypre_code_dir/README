Structure HYPRE solver code:

1) Start with NASA VSR format assembled stiffness matrix, load/residual vector, empty solution vector, and itype.
2) Call existing subroutine (map_vss_mkl) to convert VSR to CSR.
3) Call my subroutine to convert symmetric struct to non-symmetric.

Case (itype = 1)
4) Allocate for local (distributed to procs) stiffness structures.
5) Send out all of our stiffness matrix and soln/rhs vector data to procs (in contiguous blocks of rows).
Case (itype = 2 )
4-5) Send out k_indices and rhs to procs (structs already allocated).
Case (itype = 3)
4) Deallocate local (processor) stiffness structs.
5) Exit

6) Insert our local processor data to HYPRE structs.
7) Solve the system using some HYPRE method.
8) Gather the local part of the solution vector to the root process.

This directory holds several programs developed by Jonas Faleskog
at KTH in Stockholm, Sweden and Rami Haj-Ali (now Prof. of
Civil Engr. at Georgia Tech).

Included are:

mesh_scp -- a mesh generator for creating finite element models for
            surface cracks in a rectangular prism. The mesh can be
            specified to have:
              a) a "focused" mesh at the crack front for simple
                 small strain, no-growth analyses
              b) an initially blunted crack front model suitable
                 to conduct a no-growth, finite strain
                 analysis.
            The program has options to output Abaqus, Warp3D and
            Patran descriptions for the model. 


mesh_cell -- a mesh generator for creating finite element models for
            surface cracks in a rectangular prism. The mesh has "computational
            cell" elements ahead of the crack front on the crack plane.
            Such models are used for modeling ductile crack growth and
            fatigue crack closure.
            The program has options to output Abaqus, Warp3D and
            Patran descriptions for the model. 

pipe_mesh_gen -- builds really nice models for pipes and elbows
                 containing internal/external, axial/circumferential
                 flaws. Also builds models for rectangular prisms containing
                 embedded, surface and corner flaws. All models have
                 focused meshes with nodes at tip tied or untied, with or
                 without a keyhole.
                 This is a really neat program.

add_elm -- a program to modify the mesh created by mesh_scp.
           One face of the existing mesh on the rectangular prism
           is extended an arbitrary length, adding new elements and nodes
           to the model.

ssy_generator -- a mesh generator to create finite element models for
                 the SSY, boundary-layer problem. has options for
                 an initially sharp or blunt tip.

mesh_plot -- a simple fortran 77 program. ite reads *.inf and *.dat files
             generated by the mesh_scp and mesh_cell programs
             and creates PostScript files for different views of
             the generated finite element model.

scp_test_dir -- contains example input files for the mesh_scp program.
                make a directory some place on your system. copy
                one of these input files into that directory.
                run the mesh_scp code. The code asks for the name
                of the input file.

cell_test_dir -- contains an example input file for the mesh_cell program.
                please put the executable version of the mesh_cell 
                program into this directory and run the program.

pipe_test_dir -- contains a variety of example input files for the
                   pipe_mesh_program. the pipe program asks for the
                 name of the input file when it runs. it puts results
                 in the same directory with the prefix test_ on each
                 file name.

convert_8_to_20_dir  -- contains a program to convert crack models built
                        from 8 node bricks to 20 node bricks

The distributions have *.exe files for Intel PCs running
Widnows OSs for those w/o required compilers, etc. to build
the executaables.

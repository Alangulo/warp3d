add_elm -- takes a prismatic finite element model and adds layers of elements
	on one edge, allowing the model to be extended and arbitrary distance
	with the same mesh configuration on the extended side.  Reads an
	input file, and example of which is the file inp_add in this 
	directory, which is commented as to what input is required.

Just use the f90 command for your computer system to compile the
code. it is vanilla f77 code.

This directory holds the source for mesh3d_scpcell, a mesh generator
written by Jonas Faleskog which generates finite element models of
surface crack specimen.  The resulting mesh contains a crack front
modelled using computational cells.

Some minor modifications were made by Rami Haj-Ali, including 
user specification of element block size.

manual.pdf               -- Adobe PDF file for the User Manual

During execution the program makes lots of files. I strongly
recommend that you create a fresh directory, copy the example
input file there and run the code while in that directory.




To run the mesh generator, create an input file with the format described
in the manual, then type in a shell window

        scpcell.run          (on Unix)
        scpcell_windows.exe  (on Windows)

Example input files are in the ../cell_test_dir directory

The code asks for the input file and creates an input
file for one of several finite element programs (specified in the input file).


Changes made by Bob (July 1998):
--------------------------------

1) update commands output for the warp3d input file to 
   reflect recent changes in warp3d.
2) make the code ask for the input file name rather than
   forcing the name to have a certain form.

Updated makefile for Windows on Intel PCs

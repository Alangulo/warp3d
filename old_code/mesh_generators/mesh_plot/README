This is a simple f77 program to make PostScript files of different
views of the generated meshes produced by the mesh_scp and mesh_cell
programs.

To compile mesh_plot:

          f77 mesh_plot.f  <other compiler options>

To use mesh_plot:

  1) build the finite element model using the mesh_scp or mesh_cell
     program
  2) in the file you use to make the model, mesh_scp and mesh_cell
     create files with the names .._1.dat .._1.inf, .._2.dat .._2.inf
     thru .._5.inf .._5.dat
     These files contain data used by mesh_plot to create a PostScript
     file for a view (1 of 5 views) of the model.
  3) Copy the mesh_plot executable file and the Mesh_plot.stub
     file from the mesh_plot directory (this directory) to the file
     used to build the model.
  4) invoke the mesh_plot executable. the program asks for a
     a plot file name (prefix only). It wants one of the .._# file
     names witout the .inf or .dat extension.
  5) the program generates a .._#.ps file for the view of the model
  6) look at the PostScript file using Ghostview, print it or
     convert to a pdf then view it.
  7) repeat 4-6 for each of the 5 views.

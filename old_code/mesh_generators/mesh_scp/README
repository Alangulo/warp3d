This directory holds a 2001 version of mesh3d_scp, the mesh generator
written by Jonas Faleskog, with additional changes and additions by
Rami Haj-Ali and Bob Dodds in July 1998. Makefiles were updated
in July 2002.

Important files:
----------------
README -- this file

makefile_unix    -- makefile for the code (type make -f makefile_unix to
	            compile the code). may need to edit this
                    file set compiler name, options, etc. Any decent
                    Fortran 90 compiler should handle the code.

makefile_windows -- makefile for the code for Windows OSs on Intel PCs.
                    PC must have the Digital Fortran Compiler and the
                    Mortice Kern Systms toolkit installed to build the code
                    on Windows. (MKS provides a K-shell + the Unix make
                    command).

mesh3d_scp.run  -- the executable code for Unix (not included in distribution)

mesh3d_scp_windows.exe -- the executable code for Windows on Intel.

manual.ps  -- a PostScript file for the User manual
manual.pdf -- Adobe PDF file for the User Manual

To run the mesh generator, create an input file with the format described
in the manual, then in a shell window type 

	mesh3d_scp.run            on Unix
        mesh3d_scp_windows.exe    on Windows PCs

Example input files are in the ../scp_test_dir directory

The code asks for the input file and creates an input
file for one of several finite element programs (specified in the input file).


Changes made by Rami:
---------------------

1) change to the creation of the first two rings:
	The distribution of elements near the crack tip is different.  
	The radial distance for the first two rings is 12% of the distance
	between the crack tip and the region where the rings begin the
	transition out of the tubular region (the rings get 6% each). 
	The rest of the rings in the tublar region fit in the remaining 88%,
	roughly evenly spaced, I believe.

Changes made by Bob (July 1998):
--------------------------------

1) update commands output for the warp3d input file to 
   reflect recent changes in warp3d.
2) make the code ask for the input file name rather than
   forcing the name to have a certain form.

Changes made by Bob (July 2002):
-----------------------------------

1) updated makefile for Windows OSs. uses Digital Visual Fortran
   (Version 6.3B) and Mortice Kern Systems toolkit (to provide make
   program).

2) updated makefile for Unix to use f90 compiler

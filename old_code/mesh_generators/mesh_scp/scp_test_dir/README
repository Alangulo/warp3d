This directory contains 2 example input files for the mesh_scp program:

   example_1 and example_2

The mesh_scp program prompts the user for the name of the
input file. 

The program builds files with the following names:

     domain_###   : input commands to compute J-integral at some
                    point on the crack front
     patran.out.1 : Patran neutral file for the model
     *.crd        : nodal coordinates
     *.elm        : incidences (element connectivities)
     *.warp_input : main warp3d input file. uses *input from <file>
                    commands to have warp3d read from the other files
     *.cnst       : constraints that make some dof = 0
     *.prdsp      : constraints that enforce remote displacements

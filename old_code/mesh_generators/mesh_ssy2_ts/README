These programs create SSY models with blunt notches.  Output is in the form
of a complete set of warp3d input files.  Input to the programs is through 
input files; the supplied examples have comments to guide the creation of 
new files.  mesh_ssy2_ts allows specification of a T stress, while the
other does not.

the programs 

mesh_ssy.f
mesh_ssy2_ts.f

are just simple f77 code.

the *.exe files are executables for Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0 in case
you have no access to the Digital Fortran compiler.

The generated Warp3D input files can be run thru WARP3D to
create a Patran neutral file.

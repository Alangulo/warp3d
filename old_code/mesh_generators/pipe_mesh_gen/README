This directory holds the source for pipe_mesh_gen, a mesh generator
written by Jonas Faleskog. The program builds focused crack front
models for (1) rectangular prisms containing embedded, surface
and corner cracks, (2) cylinders containing internal/external, axial/
circumferential surface flaws, (3) elbows containing internal/external, axial/
circumferential surface flaws.

The program builds Patran neutral files, WARP3D input files and
ABAQUS input files. All loadings, displacement boundary conditions and
commands to get J computed along the crack front are included in the
generated input files.

This is a cool program !


Pertinent files:

During execution the program makes lots of files. I strongly
recommend that you create a fresh directory, copy the example
input file there and run the code while in that directory.

To run the mesh generator, create an input file with the format described
in the manual, then type 

        meshgen.run        (on Unix)
        meshgen_windows.exe  (on Windows - Intel)

Example input files are in the ../pipe_test_dir directory

The code asks for the input file and creates an input
file for one of several finite element programs (specified in the input file).

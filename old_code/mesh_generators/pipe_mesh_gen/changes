-------------------------------------

  1) created make files for HP workstations and Windows 95, NT4.0
      
               make_plate3d.hp
                 
               make_plate3d.w95

  2) fixed fortran errors in plate_wrp.f
     the digital fortran compiler complained about a missing ,
     in the formats that have the sequence:  t1i6
     which should be: t1, i6

  3) modified the main program: platemain.f
     to ask the user for the input data file. checks for file
     existence, prints message to user then calls plate1 as before.

  4) ran several example problems most of which bomded with invalid
     math opereators for meshes with 20 node bricks.

  5) fixed following in plate_wrp.f

        o  made the block size 128 rather than 32 (no machine
           needs small blocks for 8 node bricks)
        o  added *echo off right before the coordinates
        o  incserted single comment lines in warp input file to
           improve readability
        o  added additional commands emitted into warp input file
           in the nonlinear solution sections. this makes user
           aware that these commands are available and can be
           modified.
        o  fixed a syntax problem in the emitted 'front nodes'
           command for domain integrals. changed the l3disop word
           to the correct word 'linear'.

        Sept. 28, 1998

        o  routine  wrp_write_pressure. format 102 is 
           incorrect. it fails to leave a space between the
           element number and the keyword 'face. it also
           needs to use i6 format for the element number.
        o  modified the 'output' commands put into input file
           to generate patran binary displacements, stress and
           eformat output of a few reactions, displacements

-------------------------------------

  1) file plate1.f, routine plate1. 

      at the bottom of this subroutine there are a sequence of
      'dellocate' statements executed. for generation of pipe elbows,
      one or more of the arrays to be deallocated was never allocated in
      the first place. The fixe is to convert all the deallocate
      statements to the form:
 
         if ( allocated( var ) ) deallocate( var )

      The HP runtime environment complained about deallocating of 
      unallocated arrays.

------------------------------------
   
   1) incorporated all new changes in source code from Jonas
   2) lots of small bug fixes
   3) increased capability to hanle larger models, larger R/t
      ratios
   4) single Unix makefile include (easy to change for each Unix)
   5) modified makefile for Windows 98, NT 4.0

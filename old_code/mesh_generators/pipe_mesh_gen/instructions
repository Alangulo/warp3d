    material properties  - goes together with the "type" of analysis
    "no" defines the number of material parameters given on the next line

    if type=1     no=2
                  E= Young's modulus  ny= Poisson's ratio

    if type=2     no=5   (for ABAQUS)

                 use as many lines as necessary
                 Note that:   e = total strain (WARP3D)
                              e = plastic strain (ABAQUS)

                 
5. *GEOMETRY 

  flat plate: TGE=101 W= L= t=
            (the only case when the parameter TCR is actually used)
 
         W  = plate width
         L  = length of plate
         t  = thickness of plate

  cylinder: TGE= Rc= L=  t=
            (TCR no meaning in this case)

      TGE:  =201 (Internal Axial Crack)
            =202 (External Axial Crack)
            =203 (Internal Circumferential Crack)
            =204 (External Circumferential Crack)

         Rc = internal radius of cylinder
         L  = length of cylinder
         t  = thickness of cylinder

  pipe elbow:

   - pipe   TGE= Rc=   t=    Rp=   phi_o=
            (TCR no meaning in this case, set it =1)

      TGE:  =301 (Top Internal Axial Crack)
            =302 (Top External Axial Crack)
            =303 (Top Internal Circumferential Crack)
            =304 (Top External Circumferential Crack)
            =305 (Bottom Internal Axial Crack)
            =306 (Bottom External Axial Crack)
            =307 (Bottom Internal Circumferential Crack)
            =308 (Bottom External Circumferential Crack)

         Rc    = internal radius of cylinder
         t     = thickness of cylinder
         Rp    = centerline radius of elbow
         phi_o = angle turned by elbow (rads)


 
6. *CRACK   TCR=  a=    c= keyhole= 
            
            TCR=1 (embedded elliptical crack)
            TCR=2,3 (semi-elliptical)
            TCR=4 (edge)
             a = crack depth
             c = half the surface crack length
            Use TCR=1 for cylinder and pipe elbow configuration
            keyhole = 0  sharp crack tip
            keyhole = 1  sharp crack tip replaced with a keyhole

7. *LOAD   TBC = 1  prescribed displacement on remote boundaries

           TBC = 2  prescribed tractions on remote boundaries AND
                    internal pressure = p_int (optional)
                    (defined as normal force and bending moment)

           TBC = 3  prescribed tractions on crack face

           the required input for the different cases are

           if TBC = 1:    TBC  U_x  U_y  U_z   Phi_x  Phi_y  Phi_z
           if TBC = 2:    TBC  F_x  F_y  F_z   M_x  M_y  M_z  p_int
           if TBC = 3:    TBC  p_0  P_1  P_2   p_3  q_1  q_2  q_3

    Positive directions of displacements and forces follows naturally
    from the GLOBAL coordinate system defined for each geometry. Consider
    TGE=101, here a negative F_z will cause a positive normal stress on
    the remote boundary which tends to open the crack. Also note that
    even if all components must be given (except p_int if TBC=2) only
    a few of them will be used as defined for the different TGE-cases.

        TBC=1 ux= uy= uz= tx= ty= tz=
               (only ux &  tz  may differ from zero)

        Imposes uniform axial displacement at end of pipe opposite the
        crack. symmetry boundary conditions on other faces of
        model


        TBC=2 Fx=0  Fy=0  Fz=0   Mx=0 My=0 Mz=0  INTPRESS=
               (only Fx, Mz &  INTPRESS may differ from zero)

        Fx defines a total force applied in the global X-direction
        on far end of pipe. The force is converted to a corresponding
        uniform X-traction using the actual end are of pipe, i.e.,
        wall thickness * pi * diameter @ mid-thickness.
        The traction is then converted to equivalent forces applied to 
        nodes on the remote end. 
        ** This is total force applied over the full
        end of the pipe. If Fx=1000, then 500 is applied over the
        180-degree symmetric end of the model. **

        Mz is a global moment applied to the remote end where
        the moment acts around the global Z-axis. The moment is 
        generated by equivalent nodal forces applied over nodes on the
        remote end. Mz is imposed by X-direction equivalent 
        forces. 
        ** This is total moment applied over the full
        end of the pipe. If Mz=1000, then 500 is applied over the
        180-degree symmetric end of the model. **

        INTPRESS defines the internal pressure loading.
          -> for internal cracks, the pressure is also applied
             to the crack faces
          -> the load generator also puts a net axial force on the
             end of the pipe in the global X-direction equal to the
             the pressure * inside end area of the pipe. This force
             is added to the Fx axial force specified above. 
        
       TBC=3 p0=  p1=  p2=  p3=  q1=  q2=  q3=

       pressure loads applied to the face
        The "p" and "q" are for the cubic function of the crack face traction:
          The pressure into the crack face, P, is:
                 P(eta,zeta) = pz + p1*eta + p2*eta^2 +
                               p3*eta^3 + q1*zeta + q2*zeta^2
                               + q3*zeta^3
          where eta is in the crack depth direction, and zeta is along the
          crack surface; p0 is the constant value.
        For example, if the crack face traction varies only on the crack depth,
        set the q1,q2,q3 to zero, or if the traction varies only along
        the crack width, set p1,p2,p3 to zero.  If the crack face traction
        is constant set p0=constant value and p1,p2,p3,q1,q2,q3
        all to zero.

*MESH   etyp= mr= mf=
        only etyp=8 currently works
        mr=5 default (no. elements in r)
        mf=10 default (no. elements in theta)

  Note that if a keyhole is used mr may be increased in order to decrease
  the keyhole radius. If mf is increased the whole mesh in the model
  will be refined.

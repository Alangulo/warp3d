pat2exII is a stand-alone converter which reads in a MSC Patran neutral file and a
set of Patran compatible results files (with associated result header files)
and writes out an Exodus II file.  The Exodus II format is compatible with 
Paraview, a free post-processing visualization software, and many other pre-
and post- processing software packages (e.g. Cubit).


================================================================================
Using the program (precompiled exectuables)
================================================================================

The precompiled executables are located in the run_linux_em64t and
run_mac_os_x directories.

This is a pat2exII is a command-line program.

The program will prompt you to enter the following:

1) The filename (and path) you want for the new Exodus II file.  For example:

      /path/to/file/filename-of-exodus-file

   note the converter will overwrite an existing file with no warning and
   automatically append .exo to the end of the name you specify.

2) The path and filename to the Patran neutral file.  For example:

      /path/to/file/neutralfile.out

3) The path to the directory containing your binary and/or formatted results
   files.  For example if your w******* files are in /path/to/results then:

      /path/to/results

4) The program parses the contents of the directory you entered in step
   3, looking for Patran compatible results files.  It now needs the Patran
   "template" files corresponding to the types of results files your analysis
   outputs. The template files provide a symbolic name to each result value for a node
   or element. The easiest way to provide these is to use the built-in templates,
   which match the templates provided with patran_templates directory
   in the WARP3D distribution.  To use the built-in templates, simply type

      y

   when prompted with "Would you like to use the default templates...".
   
   If you have non-standard results files, you may need to manually input the path
   to each template file.  To enable this option enter
   
      n

   when asked if you would like to use the default templates.

   The program will request the path and filename to the template file for each
   type of result file in your results directory.  For example, say the path to
   your installation of WARP3D is /path/to/warp3d.  If you have nodal
   displacement results files present in the directory you entered in step 3,
   the program will ask for you to:

      "Input path to template file for results files with prefix wn*d"

   and you would enter

      /path/to/warp3d/patran_templates/warp_displ.res_tmpl

   and so on for the rest of your results files.

   Again, in nearly all situations users can simply select the built-in default
   templates and skip this step.

5) The program will now ask if you want to input the path to a "time map" file.
   This is primarily used for making movies of the results.
   WARP3D does not keep track of the actual time value at which each load step
   occurs at (i.e. it does not track tn+1 = tn + dt).  If you want to use the
   actual time data in Paraview you must create a file of <n> positive real
   numbers, each number on its own line, where <n> is the number of load steps
   in your analysis and the real number on line <i> corresponds to the physical
   time of load step <i>.  For an example, see test/timemap.  If you select

      y

   you will be prompted to enter the path to the time map file, for example:

      /path/to/file/timemap

   if you select

      n

   the program will continue without prompting you for a time map.

6) Now the program will process your results data (this can take a some time
   if you have many load steps in your analysis) and write out the Exodus II
   file.


================================================================================
Compiling the program
================================================================================

Precompiled executables for Linux and Mac OS X are included with 
the full distribution downloads, found on WARP3D's Google Code site.  
Compiling from source is unnecessary.

If you would like to compile a version of pat2exII from source, refer to the
operating system specific READMEs found in this directory.

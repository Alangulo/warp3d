Note: Precompiled executables are included with downloadable distribution, found on
WARP3D's Google Code site.  Compiling from source is unnecessary if you have 
the exectuables.

Linux Compilation
================================================================================

For Linux we provide precompiled, static versions of all the libraries pat2exII
requires. To install them automatically to the $WARP3D_HOME/pat2exII/lib
directory, go to your WARP3D_HOME directory and run the script
"install_libs_from_remote", for example:

      cd $WARP3D_HOME
      ./install_libs_from_remote

Once you have done that:

1) Enter the pat2exII directory in the WARP3D source.

2) Copy configurations/Makefile.inc.linux to ./Makefile.inc

3) Run make.

      make

4) Check to make sure everything compiled correctly.

      make check

   If the check succeeds, a file called ./testex.exo will be created and you will
   receive no errors from the pat2exII executable.

5) To install to $WARP3D_HOME/run_linux_em64t run:

      make install

6) If you want to clean the pat2exII compile directories (of all object and
   executable files) run:

      make clean

Note: Precompiled executables are included with downloadable distribution, found on
WARP3D's Google Code site.  Compiling from source is unnecessary if you have 
the exectuables.

================================================================================
Mac Compilation (about a 30 min process)
================================================================================

You will need to install the following free packages:

hdf (version 5)
netcdf (version 4)
cmake (version 2.8)
exodus (version 5.14)

This guide assumes you want to install the packages to /usr/local and assumes a
you are using the BASH shell in the Terminal program.  

** You will need "root" access to install the above libraries **

1) Create a working directory to hold the compressed package files and their
   compilation directories.  In this example we refer to ~/src.  So, for
   example:
      
      mkdir ~/src
      cd ~/src

2) hdf5

      a) Download the most recent SOURCE gzipped hdf5 package (listed under All
         Platforms) from:

            http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html

         to ~/src.  Extract the .tar.gz using:
   
            tar xvzf ____.tar.gz

         (where ____ is the name of the most current hdf5 packages) and enter
         the directory.

      b) Run (takes about 5 minutes)

            ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make

      c) Run 

            sudo make install

3) netcdf4

      a) Download the top-listed, gzipped NetCDF C/C++/Fortran stable release
         source package from:

            http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp

         Extract the .tar.gz as above and enter the directory.

      b) Run (takes about 2 minutes)

            ./configure --prefix=/usr/local && make

      c) Run

            sudo make install

4) cmake

      a) Obtain the most recent gzipped SOURCE version of cmake from:

            http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
         
         The correct package should be listed under Platform -> Unix/Linux
         Source.

         Extract the .tar.gz as above and enter the directory

      b) Run (takes several minutes)

            ./bootstrap --prefix=/usr/local

      c) Run (takes several minutes)

            make

      d) Run

            sudo make install

5) exodusII

      a) Obtain the most recent version of exodusII from:

            http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii/

         Click on the green download button on that page to obtain the
         .tar.bz2 file.

         Extract the bzipped file with:
         
            tar xvjf _____.tar.bz2

         and enter the directory.  Then enter the "exodus" directory:

            cd exodus

      b) Run 

            ccmake .

      c) Make sure that the netCDF library was located correctly.

      d) Type

            c

         then (again)

            c
    
         then

            g

      e) Run

            make

      f) Run
      
            sudo make install

If step 5-f completed successfully you have correctly installed the required
libraries.  Return to the WARP3D source directory ($WARP3D_HOME) to compile
the pat2exII converter program.

6) pat2exII

      a) Enter the pat2exII directory in the WARP3D source.

            cd $WARP3D_HOME/pat2exII

      b) Copy configurations/Makefile.inc.mac to ./Makefile.inc

      c) Run

            make

      d) You can run 

            make check

         to ensure the program pat2exII works.  It should generate a
         ./testex.exo file and give no errors during the conversion process.

      e) To install the program to the $WARP3D_HOME/run_mac_os_x directory
         type:

            make install

      f) If you want to clean up the pat2exII directory of all object and 
         executable files, run:
            
            make clean

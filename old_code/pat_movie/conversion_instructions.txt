                      TIF To GIF Translator: User's Guide


PROGRAM PURPOSE:

The TIF to GIF Translator (a C Shell script) uses the ImageMagick conversion 
program to create an animated GIFF file from a collection of individual TIFF 
image files illustrating WARP3D results.  An animated GIFF file may be viewed 
using a web browser, such as Netscape Navigator, or it may be embedded into a 
Microsoft PowerPoint presentation.  This translator is a companion program
to the WARP3D to PATRAN Animation Utility.



HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS:

The user first runs the WARP3D to PATRAN Animation Utility and plays the 
resulting session file in PATRAN that generates a series of TIFF image files.
These TIFF files should have the same prefix and appear in sequential order 
(ie, movie_1.tif, movie_2.tif, ..., movie_n.tif).  This program first converts
the TIFF files into GIFF files of the same name(s).  These GIFF files are then
bound into a single, multi-image (animated) GIFF file.  The user has the option
to put a few seconds of delay time between images as well as to delete the 
intermediate GIFF files.



EXECUTING THIS UTILITY PROGRAM:

Run the script tif_to_gif and answer the questions as they appear.  If the
program completes successfully, the animated gif file is stored in *.gif, 
where * represents a user designated name.

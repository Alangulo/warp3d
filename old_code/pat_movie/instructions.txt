                 WARP3D To PATRAN Animation Utility: User's Guide



PROGRAM PURPOSE:

The WARP3D to PATRAN Animation Utility (a C++ program) creates a PATRAN session
file based on user input obtained through a text-based question/answer interface.
Running the session file in PATRAN generates an MPEG movie file animating 
WARP3D results or a series of TIF image files illustrating WARP3D results.



CHOOSING BETWEEN MPEG MOVIES AND TIFF IMAGES:

The user choses to create an animated .mpg movie or a series of .tif
image files.  

MPEG movies normally play at the rate of 30 frames per second.  Therefore, the 
number of frames created directly influences the playing time of the movie.  
Some MPEG players provide an option to reduce the frame display rate.  In this
utility program, the WARP3D results files designated by the user become key 
frames for creating the PATRAN animation.  When the number of frames desired for
the movie is greater than the number of key frames available from results files,
PATRAN interpolates linearly between key frames to create the animation.  For 
best results, the number of requested movie frames should be one less than an 
integer multiple of the number of PATRAN results files available.  The MPEG 
movie created during the PATRAN job is named after the PATRAN database.  
Indicators such as "fringe" (if a stress or strain fringe is created) or 
"deformation" (if a deformation is animated) also appear in the MPEG name.  To 
signal PATRAN that MPEG recording is complete, the user must hit the UNDO button 
when the PATRAN command line reads:
        $# Session file stopped playing (level 1)

TIFF files store a single image from the PATRAN viewport.  However, the companion
tif_to_gif C-Shell program binds the tif files into a single animated gif movie.
A single TIFF file is created for each WARP3D results file designated by the user.
The TIFF files are created in the sequence *_1.tif, *_2.tif, etc., where * 
represents a user input default name.  If TIFF files of the same name already 
exist in the directory, PATRAN begins the numbering sequence from the last 
pre-existing file.



PRIOR TO RUNNING THIS UTILITY PROGRAM:

Before running this utility program, follow the steps below:
1) Note the location of the WARP3D template files used for importing WARP3D 
   results into PATRAN.  These templates are usually stored in your 
   /<PATRAN>/res_templates/ directory.  The file path is requested as input
   by this utility program.
2) Change to the directory that stores the WARP3D produced results files for
   post processing.
3) Start PATRAN in this directory.
4) Open the appropriate PATRAN database for the model.
5) Scale/translate/rotate the model as you wish it to appear in the movie.



EXECUTING THIS UTILITY PROGRAM:

Build the executable for the program.  Name it movie.go.  Run movie.go in the
directory that contains the PATRAN results files and answer the questions as 
they appear.  If a results file at a required load/time step does not exist, 
the program terminates without writing a session file to create the movie.  
Otherwise, the session file is stored in *.ses.01, where * indicates a user 
designated name selected during the input process.  Make sure to read each 
question fully before responding.  If an error occurs in the input process, 
use Ctrl-X to stop execution and try again.

Remember, if creating an MPEG movie, the user must hit UNDO when the session
file completes playing.  This action signals PATRAN to finish MPEG encoding.



TIPS AND HINTS:

1) Users should notice the commands that PATRAN executes.  Many aspects
   of PATRAN's command language are easily understood.  For example, "@" in
   a session file indicates that the command is continued on the next line.
   Spacing is also very important, especially spaces that precede filenames. 
   A rudimentary understanding of PATRAN commands allows the user to
   troubleshoot small problems, toggle settings, and even extend the 
   capabilities of this utility program.  

2) Animated gifs play in Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, or 
   Microsoft PowerPoint.  ImageMagick and other gif-viewing packages are 
   available on many UNIX machines.

3) MPEG movies play in Internet Explorer or PowerPoint by using Window's
   MediaPlayer.  Occassionally, MediaPlayer fails to recognize an MPEG
   movie.  One way to alleviate this problem is to size the PATRAN viewport 
   and re-record the MPEG at the "default" size.  Enter the following 
   command to size the viewport:
       ga_viewport_size_set("default_viewport",5.964382,6.311515,1)

4) Animated gifs often appear choppy because there is no interpolation
   between frames.  Creating a smaller viewport window improves the 
   appearance and greatly reduces the file size of the finished product.
   Try reducing the viewport window to three or four inches on a side.

5) Each time a session file created with this program is played, the
   specified results files are imported into PATRAN.  You may edit the
   session file in any text editor and remove the import commands to avoid 
   having several copies of each result file stored in your PATRAN
   database.  Removing these commands also saves time during execution of
   the session file.  Each file imported requires two commands of the
   following type:

      resold_import_results( "/finite/webe00002",  "E", 1E-06, @
      "/apps/msc/patran90/res_templates/warp_elem_" // "strain.res_tmpl" )

      uil_app_results2.set_update_display(  )

   This example imports webe00002, the element strains for load step two
   of an analysis.  The filenames change according to the number and type 
   of results.  Look for similar commands in your session file and delete
   them each time they occur. 

6) When deformations are post-processed, the PATRAN model displayed in the 
   viewport should change color.  If this color change does not occur, then 
   there is an error in the session file.  Check that the structure name you 
   provided matches that of the WARP3D input file which created the results 
   and is no more than eight alpha-numeric characters long.  Do not rename 
   WARP3D results files, as this creates a mismatch between the filename and
   the PATRAN-read load step.
   

EXAMPLES:

Two transcripts illustrating use of the utility program to create PATRAN 
session files are included in this help file.

The first of these transcripts is presented below.  The PATRAN session file 
created by this set of inputs records a series of TIFF files detailing the
deformation of a WARP3D model, named microcrack in the present example.  A
custom load step list is used to import results files wnbd00002, wnbd00004,
wnbd00008, wnbd00012, wnbd00020, wnbd00022, wnbd00024, wnbd00028, wnbd00032,
and wnbd00040.

TIFF FILES OF DEFORMED SHAPE: TRANSCRIPT BEGINS

Welcome to the WARP3D To PATRAN Animation Utility.

This program creates a PATRAN session file.  When played, this session
file drives the execution of PATRAN to read WARP3D results files and to create
either a series of image (.tif) files or an animated (.mpg) movie.  If
desired, TIFF files can be subsequently converted to an animated (.gif) movie
using the C-shell program, tif_to_gif, which accompanies this utility program.

Do you wish to create an MPEG movie or a series of TIFF image files?
Please select an output format from the options below.
   1) A series of TIFF image files. (One image file per result file.)
   2) An animated MPEG movie.

You have selected to create a series of .tif files.
One image will be created for each specified WARP3D result file.
These images may be bound afterward into an animated (.gif) file using
the tif_to_gif conversion program.

You will be asked to select a default name for the series of tif
files.  The .tif extension will be added automatically.  This
extension will be preceded by a number indicating the placement of
an image file in the results sequence.  That is, files will be named
*_1.tif, *_2.tif, etc., where * indicates the default name.
Please enter a name for the tif files now.
File name for *.tifs: deformed_shape


What type of results are you post-processing?
Please select an option from the following menu: 
   1) Deformed shapes.
   2) Stress fringes.
   3) Strain fringes.
   4) Stress fringes on deformed shapes.

TIFF FILES OF DEFORMED SHAPE: TRANSCRIPT ENDS
*******************************************************************************


The following sample transcript illustrates the utility program's MPEG 
capabilities.  The session file generated from these inputs records a .mpg 
movie displaying the Von Mises stress over the deformed shape of a WARP3D 
model named ssy.  A constant load step list selects results files wnbd00002,
wnbd00012, wnb00022, wnbd00032, wnbd00042, and the corresponding stress 
results.  The movie contains nineteen frames of these five load steps.  PATRAN 
linearly interpolates four times between each load step to create the 
animation.

MPEG MOVIE OF STRESS FRINGE ON DEFORMED SHAPE: TRANSCRIPT BEGINS

Welcome to the WARP3D To PATRAN Animation Utility.

This program creates a PATRAN session file.  When played, this session
file drives the execution of PATRAN to read WARP3D results files and to create
either a series of image (.tif) files or an animated (.mpg) movie.  If
desired, TIFF files can be subsequently converted to an animated (.gif) movie
using the C-shell program, tif_to_gif, which accompanies this utility program.

Do you wish to create an MPEG movie or a series of TIFF image files?
Please select an output format from the options below.
   1) A series of .tif image files. (One image file per result file.)
   2) An animated .mpg movie.
Output Format: 2


You have chosen to create a .mpg movie.

WARP3D results files become key frames of the movie.  If you
select a number of frames higher than the number of results
files, PATRAN interpolates linearly between results files
to create the extra frames.  For this reason, animations
should contain an integer multiple of the number of WARP3D
results files being animated.  The movie will play at 30 frames
per second.
How many frames do you want in the movie?
Frames: 19


What type of results are you post-processing?
Please select an option from the following menu:

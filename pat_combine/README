README for pat_combine tool in WARP3D
=====================================

last update: July 1, 2011 (RHD)

This file describes the process to build the executable
for the program pat_combine. When WARP3D runs parallel suign MPI
with domain decompostion (via MPI), each process outputs "partial" 
patran result files for element strains/stresses and nodal strains/stresses. 

Example: an analysis is performed using 32 processors and
nodal stress output is requested at load step 43, then
32 "partial" files of results are created with names
wnbs00043.0000, wnbs00043.0001, .... wnbs00043.0031

Before the results can be read into Patran for post-processing, the 32 files
must be first "combined" into a single, conventional Patran
result file named wnbs00043.

The "pat_combine" program performs this operation. pat_combine requires
no input from the user; it surveys the directory
in which it is run looking for partial result files of all types.
It automatically builds the combined results files as needed.

To build the pat_combine program, just run the (Bash) shell script named
build_linux64 or build_osx (located in this directory).

Supported platforms are: Linux and Mac OS X

The executable file is placed into the appropriate warp3d/run_xx 
directory.

NOTE:
=====

The pat_combine program can run in parallel to process files for the load
steps using OpenMP. To run with parallel, set the environment
variable for OpenMP to indicate the number of threads (processors)
the code is allowed to use. For example,

      % setenv OMP_NUM_THREADS 8
      % ~/warp3d/run_linux_em64t/pat_combine.go

Other tools
-----------

The compare_formatted.f and comapre_binary.f are simple programs that
compare two Patran binary or froamtted result files for equality.
These aere developed and used during testing of pat_combine.f and may
prove useful for other purposes as well. Just compile with ifort as needed.

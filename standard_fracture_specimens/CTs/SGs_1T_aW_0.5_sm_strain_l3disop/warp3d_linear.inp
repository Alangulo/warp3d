c
c        21 (variable) layers through half-thickness in tube mesh region
c        along crack front. 
c
c        focused mesh for non-growth analysis. initially 
c        collapsed element at front.
c
c        pin hole filled with linear elastic elements with connection
c        to specimen only along top of hole.
c   
c        8-node elements. small strain formulation.
c
c        displacement control (center of loading pin)
c
c     Nonlinear material:    (deformation or mises)
c         E      = 30,000  ksi 
c         sig_ys = 60.0 ksi
c         n = 10 (for small strains)  
c
c     Model is loaded by imposed displacements (w) at the center
c     of the pin (modeled with stiffer, linear-elastic elements).
c     The same v displacement is imposed at each through-thickness 
c     node.
c
c     Pin loading of 1 mils leads to:
c
c     J average = 0.003847 kip-in/in**2
c     KI-average = 11.262 ksi-in**0.5
c        J centerplane = 0.003553 kip-in/in**2
c        KI centerplane = 10.823 ksi-in**0.5
c        KI factor on load: 10.823/(2*.6794) = 7.965 (=f below)
c
c     The total LLD displacement (=2 x v @ @ node 13060) 
c     is 2 * 0.0008889 in.)
c
c     The pin loading for this displacement is: 2 x 0.6794 kips
c      (2 because only 1/2 of the thickness is modeled)
c
c     The 2-D analytical SIF load factor this specimen:
c         KI = 7.636 * load  ksi-in**0.5, using (B*BN*W)**0.5. 
c
c     The load / LLD stiffness is = (2 x 0.6794) / (2 x 0.0008889)
c                                 = 764.315 kips/in
c     KI (average) factor.  KI = f * pin load (total)
c                 f = 11.262/ (2 x 0.6794) = 8.288 ksi-in**0.5 / kips
c
c     Check on J value. Run same model with whole crack tip
c     region offset in x-dir by (+,-) 0.01 in.
c     Get internal energy for each analysis.
c
c     J = 4 * energy difference / (2 * Bnet * 0.01)
c       = 0.003843 compared to 0.003847 above from domain J-values.
c         Excellent agreement.

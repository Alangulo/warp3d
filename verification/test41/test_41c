!      test rigid contact of a body inside a sphere
!      expanding outward under pressure and contacting
!      the sphere
!
!      model is a piece of a 1 unit thick hemisphere with
!      inner radius 9.0, outer radius 10.0
!      planes x,y,z= 0 are symmetry
!
!      model made by:
!         1) sweep a line segment 9 <= x <= 10 about z for +30-degrees
!            to create an arc surface in x-y plane
!         2) sweep the arc surface -30 degrees aroud +Y to make a solid
!         3) rotate that solid twice more -30 degrees around +Y to
!            finish a partial hemisphere that lies entirely in 1st quadrant
!
!      apply increasing pressure to inner surface of those elements only
!      in solid one to create a nonuniform and increasing contact area
!      with pressure
!
!      the rigid contact surface is a sphere with radius 10.01

c   Mode I crack growth analysis in a C(T) specimen using 
c   interface elements and cohesive constitutive model
c **********************************************************
c
c   Model:
c   ------
c     problem units are kips and inches
c     model has one layer of solid elements over the thickness 
c     to reduce run time for purpose of an example problem.
c     W = 2.0 inches, B = mesh thickness B= 0.0225 inches
c     Initial a/W = 0.24, initial remaining ligament length = 1.52 in.
c     This is a 1/4 symmetric (i.e. full model would have 2 element
c     layers over full thickness in 3-D).
c     Model is not contrained to be in plane strain.
c     Background solitd elements are 8-node hex. 
c
c     model is placed in 1st (XYZ) quadrant. crack plane is Y=0,
c     mid-thickness symmetry plane is Z=0
c
c     Interface elements are 8-node, zero initial thickness.
c     Size on crack plane is Le= 0.02 in. in direction 
c     (+X) of crack extension. 76 interface elements defined
c     on initial ligamment = 1.52 in (analysis can effectively
c     grow crack across entire ligament)
c
c     displacement control loading at center of "pins"
c     holes are plugged with linear-elastic material to
c     "smooth" deformations in loading area. 
c
c   Materials:
c   ---------
c     Background: A2024-T3 aluminum, E = 10356 ksi, yiled = 48.5 ksi,
c                 power-law hardening n = 10 (true-stress vs. log eps)
c
c     Cohesive: exp1_intf option. simple exponential formulation. User
c               sets the peak traction and opening displacement at
c               peak traction. Model computes fracture energy and
c               initial linear stiffness. For this symemtric
c               model, we input 1/2 of actual opening displacement
c               at peak stress since only 1/2 the "thickness" of the
c               interface elements exists in the symmetry model.
c               The cohesive elements represent a Mode I response
c               for a material with toughness Jc = 0.154 kip-in/in**2
c               (or KJc = 42 ksi-sqrt(in)).
c     Pin holes: displacement control loading at center of "pins"
c                holes are plugged with linear-elastic material to
c                "smooth" deformations in loading area.

c  Solution details:
c  -----------------
c
c   large displacement "nonlinear" element formulations used
c   for solid and interface elements
c
c   analysis runs for 500 load steps which kills about
c   30 cohesive elements (total delta "a" = 0.6 inches)
c
c   crack growth parameters may be adjusted to alter predicted
c   load vs. Delta-a behvior: especially the multiplier on
c   peak (critical) displacement at which point the element is considered
c   failed and has no further load capacity.

#  Axial extension of a notched round bar -- creep material
#  --------------------------------------------------------
#
#  Norton power-law creep model
#
#
#  Axi-symmetric model of a small notch tensile specimen.
#  This is the 0.25" diameter specimen with 0.004 in. elements in
#  the notch region. The model is set up with square elements for
#  the lower row of 0.004 in. size elements. The transformation
#  matrix is for a 1 degree rotation about the axis of revolution.
#  This was accomplished by sweeping the a 2-D model of 4-node elements
#  in Patran about the Y-axis. However, Patran would not allow a zero
#  radius for nodes during this process. Nodes on the axis were
#  made to have r=0.00001 in. After sweeping about the Z-axis,
#  the nodes were reset to r=0.0. For the 8-node Warp3D elements 
#  with a face collapsed to a line on r=0, there are 8 unique 
#  node ids.
#
#  Model is top-half, axisymmetric (1-degree slice)
#
#  Full bar dimensions:
#    Height:           2.00 in.   50.8 mm
#    Outside diameter: 0.50 in.   12.7 mm
#    Throat diameter:  0.25 in.    6.35 mm
#    Slot height:      0.50 in.   12.7 mm
#
#  Coordinates have units: mm
#  Time: hours
#
#  The material behavior for this example is described by:
#
#      E = 150,000 MPa 
#      n = 6  nu = 0.285
#      creep coefficient: B = 1.0e-16 MPa**(-n)/secs
#
#  Impose axial extension for 15 hrs, then hold extension
#  and let bar relax.
